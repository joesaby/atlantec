This repo contains output research and solution of work done of the "AI Alchemists" team as part of [Atlantec AI Challenge 2025](https://atlantec.ie/atlantec-ai-challenge/). 

## Overview

The Atlantec AI Challenge is designed to harness artificial intelligence for addressing critical societal challenges in Ireland, with a focus on collaborative innovation across academia, industry, and government sectors.

**Core Objectives**

- Develop ethical AI-driven solutions with practical applications
- Advance skills development in artificial intelligence technologies
- Transition from siloed operations to collaborative, cross-sector efforts

**Guiding Principles**

The challenge is guided by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and emphasizes ethical considerations in all proposed solutions.

## Team formation and Research
We used the guiding principles to form our team and conduct our research. 

**Week 1: Primary Research (completed by 25 April 2025)**
At first we focussed on public available data and built possible selection of topics. Read the [primary-research](topics/primary-research.md) for more details. Here we used github copilot's agent mode to help us with the research that has public available data. Using generative AI to our advantage helped us save precious time and focus on the most important aspect of the challenge. Time taken here was about 2 hours to sit together in a meeting. This was completed by 

**Week 2: Secondary Research (completed by 6 May 2025)**
Next step was, each member of the team picked a topic that most interested them, do a bit of secondary research and come up with a proposal. Ask was everyone comes back with their topics research and completed by 6th of May 2025. 

**Week 3: Development (completed by 13 May 2025)** (in progress)
Next step was, each member of the team picked a topic that most interested them, do a bit of secondary research and come up with a proposal. Ask was everyone comes back with their topics research and completed by 6th of May 2025.
